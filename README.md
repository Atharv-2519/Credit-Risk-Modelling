This project focuses on building a credit card approval prediction app that allows applicants to estimate their chances of credit card approval without initiating a hard credit inquiry, thereby preserving their credit score. Using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, the project applies a full machine learning pipeline involving data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, bivariate and multivariate correlation analysis, and model evaluation. Several classification models were tested, including Support Vector Machines, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting, with Gradient Boosting achieving the highest recall score of 90%. Since the model is intended for use in a bull market scenario—when financial institutions are more open to approving credit—the recall metric was prioritized to ensure the model captures as many true positive (eligible) applicants as possible. The most predictive features identified were education level, relationship status, capital gain, hours worked, and age, while features such as occupation and work class were found to be less informative. The app was built using Python and Streamlit for the user interface, with the trained model hosted on AWS S3. Limitations of the project include the outdated nature of the dataset (originating from the 1990s) and the use of RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, which could be further optimized using GridSearchCV. Overall, this tool offers a practical, user-friendly solution for pre-screening credit card eligibility while providing insights into key applicant characteristics that influence credit approval decisions.

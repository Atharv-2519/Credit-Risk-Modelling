Credit Card Approval Prediction App
Business Problem
Each time a user applies for a credit card, a hard credit inquiry occurs, potentially reducing their credit score. This app provides a risk-free, predictive tool that estimates the probability of credit card approval using historical dataâ€”without triggering a hard inquiry. It empowers applicants to gauge their chances of approval in advance, helping them make informed financial decisions.
